## 🧠 Why I'm Building This

This project is part of my journey to **strengthen my backend development skills** and build something real, not just tutorials.  
I'm sharing each step, from schema design to authentication — publicly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grecia-bueno-57a07512a/) as I go.  
The goal is to show recruiters and engineers how I think, build, and iterate as well as to receive any helpful advice they can give me from their experience.

This project is being built incrementally.  
Expect frequent updates and refactors as I learn and improve the design.
